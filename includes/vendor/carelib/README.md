CareLib is a drop-in library for WordPress parent themes. You can learn more about it by reading our [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/cipherdevgroup/carelib/wiki) and see an implementation of it in our [Alpha starter theme](https://github.com/cipherdevgroup/alpha).

Many of the ideas and concepts in CareLib were derived from the [Hybrid Core](https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core) framework by [Justin Tadlock](https://github.com/justintadlock).
