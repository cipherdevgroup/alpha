# Changelog for CareLib

# 1.0.0

First stable release! Changes from here forward will be more well-documented and backwards compatible.

## 0.2.0

Too many changes to list. I probably should have released like 10 versions by this point, but nobody is really using this library as far as I can tell, so eh.

The primary reason I'm pushing this release is because we're making some MAJOR changes for the 1.0.0 release. In order to maintain some level of backwards compatibility with our existing projects and themes, we need to tag this version now so they don't all need to be updated.

## 0.1.0

First release.
